# Leaf_Project

### The project is to train a model that combines convolutional autoencoder and image recognition and display the resulting GUI.
#### It is OK if the GUI display looks like SystemGUI_Picture.png. Please import libraries as needed.

### Dataset
Dataset is [PlantVillage](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1).
Disease dataset, but classified by plants only. However, background images are excluded.

### Program Flow(To be performed in the following sequence)
1. Convolutional_AutoEncoder.py<br>
   1.1. Code for Convolutional Autoencoder design<br>
2. Classification.py<br>
   2.1. Design code for Image Recognition Model<br>
3. AutoEncoder_Train.py<br>
   3.1. Code for learning Convolutional Autoencoder<br>
4. Classification_Train.py<br>
   4.1. Code for learning Image Recognition Model<br>
5. System_GUI.py<br>
   5.1 Display for evaluation of Combined Models<br>
